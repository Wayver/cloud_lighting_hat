# cloud_lighting_hat

Code I created to run lightning animations on an arduino UNO connected to an RGBW neopixel strip and IR sensor (with remote) as part of a thundercloud hat costume.

The IR remote allows users to adjust the frequency, brightness, and hue of the lightning effects.

This code makes use of moving average functions copied from https://forum.arduino.cc/t/cloud-lightning-neopixel-and-led-lamp-with-a-mode-button/353260.
